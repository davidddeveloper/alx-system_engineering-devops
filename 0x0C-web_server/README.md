# Web server

![Illustrating a web server](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-sysadmin_devops/266/8Gu52Qv.png)

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

But my answer file would contain:

    sylvain@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Configuring a server with specification XYZ
    echo hello world > /tmp/test
    sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sylvain@ubuntu
